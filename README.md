# ðŸ“Œ Mondit - Finance Tracker App

A **finance tracker web application** designed to help users efficiently manage their income and expenses.

Developed to explore user authentication, API integrations, full-stack app deployment, session management, and a dynamic system for data calculations. This project is a challenging and creative way that helped me deepen my understanding of both backend and frontend development.
